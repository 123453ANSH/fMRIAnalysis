= fMRIAnalysis

Analyzing fMRI data to reproduce journal paper results, draw further conclusions with dataset - all details in attached jupyter notebook

== Project Implementation Details: 

- developed fully automated fMRI data analysis pipeline
- utilized several statistical analysis techniques (eg. regression, fMRI affine transformations, peak amplitude algorithm, peak detection algorithm, low-pass filter)

Directly from notebook: 

This notebook reproduces (not authentically, read on) the results of the following journal article (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6681173/). This notebook shows correlations of certain regions of the brain with study participants e-device usage; the results we reproduce are evidence that e-device usage negatively affects reading ability. An in depth analysis as to why our results are evidence that e-device usage negatively affects reading ability can be found at the following link (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U0a1Yu9dbpfeNmXhKcDjyGcWR9IlycnVrfcJwtM-UVg/edit?usp=sharing).
